#### A little about me...
Hi! My name is R. R. Johnson, I'm 32 years old, and I'm a compulsive liar. ðŸ™‚

I'm a brazilian undergraduate student at the Mechatronics Engineering course at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

I started coding at the beginning of my course (2017). I began with C, moved on to C++ and (after 4 years of demonizing it for not having brackets) Python is now my favorite language.

You can check my GitHub page on https://LuisHenri.github.io/.

By the way, my name is LuÃ­s Henrique, and I'm 22. :)
